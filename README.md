# Car Sales Prediction: Utilizing Multiple Linear Regression Model

## Project Overview

This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting car sales prices using a multiple linear regression model. The project aims to analyze various features of car listings and build a predictive model to estimate car prices accurately. The main steps of the project include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into the dataset, understanding the distribution of key variables, and identifying patterns or trends in car listings.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from the car listing data that can be used for price prediction. This may involve data transformation and feature selection.

4. Data Visualization: Visualizing relationships between different features and car prices using appropriate charts and graphs.

5. Multiple Linear Regression Model: Building and training a multiple linear regression model to predict car prices based on the selected features.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as R-squared and data visualization.


## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/:** Contains the car sales dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks documenting the step-by-step process of the project, from data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.
- **results/:** Outputs of the project, including model predictions, visualizations, and any additional findings.
- **README.md:** The main documentation file providing an overview of the project and its contents.

## Requirements

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

The specific versions of the libraries used can be found in the requirements.txt file.
